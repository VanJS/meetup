VanJS is now in the hands of the community – starting with documenting some of our approaches and thinking on how the meetup works, and getting an open and collaborative talk selection and scheduling system going.

## Goals

VanJS has been a community production since 2009. Our high-level goals are:

1. Connect and educate the JavaScript community in Vancouver
2. Foster a culture of quality and respect
3. Stay focused on developer-centric topics and events
4. Support newcomers and underrepresented groups in our community

## Code of Conduct

We have a **[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cambiecollective/vanjs/blob/master/CONDUCT.md)**. It's short and sweet, so please give it a read.

## Speaking

We have a **[Speaking at VanJS Guide](https://github.com/cambiecollective/vanjs/blob/master/SPEAKING.md)**! Check it out, then propose a talk you'd like to share with the group.
